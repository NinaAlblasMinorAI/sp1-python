# Dictionaries

Dictionaries are one of the fundamental data structures of Python, and
just like lists, they can be used to store several elements together in
one variable. Unlike lists, dictionaries store *mappings* from a key to a
value.

### Practice

Test your understanding with the following practice exercises. Use your usual code editor and create a file called `dictionaries.py`. You can check (some of) your answers here: [answers](/python/en/dictionaries/answers)

**Exercise 1** Similar to the video, create a dictionary called `my_class` with students and grades. Use the names Ralph, Diana, Jordi, and Michele with their respective grades: 4, 8, 7, and 5.

**Exercise 2** Add a student Gretel to the above dictionary with a grade of 9. Print the dictionary `my_class` to check if Gretel is indeed added to the dictionary.

**Exercise 3** Write a piece of code that asks the user to input a name and looks in the dictionary `my_class` if the student exists. Print the message "[name] is a student in this class, and has the grade: [grade]." or "[name] is not a student in this class.", depending on whether or not the student is in the dictionary `my_class`. Example usage

	python dictionaries.py
	Enter a name: Jordi
	Jordi is a student in this class, and has the grade: 7.

Use the `in` operator for this exercise. Do not use `get()`.

**Exercise 4** Use the following list of students:

	students = ["Michele", "Diana", "Maria", "Ralph", "Jacobus"]

Write a loop that looks up each student from the lists in `my_class` and prints "[name]: [grade]" on a new line for each student. If the student doesn't exists in `my_class` it should print the text "n/a" for the grade. Expected output:

	Michele: 5
	Diana: 8
	Maria: n/a
	Ralph: 4
	Jacobus: n/a

Use `get()` for this. Do not use `in` and do not use an `if`-statement.

### Practice

**Exercise 5**
Measure the dictionaries and list in a similar way as in the video, but now focus on the `in` operator. Use runs with lists and dictionaries of different sizes. Use 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 (ad maybe 100,000 if you have a fast computer). For every run, execute the `in`-operation 100,000 times (to get reliable results). Write down the results (you can do this manually), and create a table with the runtimes that looks something like this:

	size  |  list |  dict
	10    |  0.14 |  0.09
	100   | ??.?? | ??.??
	1000  | ??.?? | ??.??
	10000 | ??.?? | ??.??

You can use the code below to get started

	from time import time
	from random import randint

    # create a list or dictionary containing n items

	# test speed
	iterations = 100000
	start = time()
	for _ in range(iterations):

		# TODO: enter code to test

	end = time()
	print(f'The time elapsed: {end-start:.2f} seconds (with {iterations} iterations)')
