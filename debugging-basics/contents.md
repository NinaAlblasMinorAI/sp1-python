# Debugging

You wrote code and it doesn't work. Now what?

That your code doesn't work immediately is normal. This is part of programming, even for experienced programmers. You need to learn effective strategies to find and solve the problem.

The worst thing you can do is just trying to randomly change things in the hope it will start working.

The second worst thing you can do is to throw away all your code and start with an entirely different approach without fully understanding why your original approach didn't work. (I call this the Wile E. Coyote strategy.)

And just staring at your code in the hope that you'll find the problem just by looking at it, also isn't very effective.

Learning to effectively find and solve problems in your code is an essential part of learning computer programming.  You'll get better at it through practice. The videos in here are to help you get started with this process.

## Tracing
To be able to find problems with your code, you first need to understand exactly what your code does. It helps to be able to step through your code in the exact same way as your computer does, this is called *tracing*. Watch here:

## Types of problems
There are different types of bugs that can plague your code. Learn how to recognize the type of problem:

## Debugging logical errors
The most difficult issue to deal with is a logical error. Your code doesn't actually throw an error, it runs seemingly fine, but it produces incorrect results. How to deal with this? Watch here:
